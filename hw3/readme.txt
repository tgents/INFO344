Write Up:

[70pts] End-to-End experience
	results page with URLs from crawler: uses PA3
	NBA player stats (when relevant): uses PA1 with modified php to return jsonp
	query suggestion shows up correctly & quickly: uses PA2 wiki titles
	dashboard: expanded PA3 dashboard to include trie controls
	caching: uses a dictionary to store a string key and a tuple that holds the list of results and datetime
	monetization: Since Google has some weird requirements, I opted to be donation funded. Feel free to donate, I'll probably be over the limit soon.
[20pts] Code written in C# â€“ C# best practices!
	Mostly in C# and I think I got most of these in PA2 and PA3 so I think it should be ok.
[10pts] Works on Azure & AWS, proper use of all infrastructure modules
	Yup.

Extra Credit:

[up to 10pts] Beautiful search results page (styling, photos, etc)
	I think it looks pretty good, but I didn't do anything too special, just some bootstrap styling and minor css work to keep it orderly.
